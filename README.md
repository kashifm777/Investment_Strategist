## üß† How It Works

This application utilizes the `agno` library to create specialized AI agents that work together to provide investment insights:

1.  **Market Analyst:** This agent retrieves and compares the historical performance of the provided stock symbols over a 6-month period using Yahoo Finance data.
2.  **Company Researcher:** This agent fetches detailed information about each company, including its sector, market capitalization, business summary, and the latest news headlines, also using Yahoo Finance.
3.  **Stock Strategist:** This agent analyzes the market performance data and company-specific information to generate potential stock recommendations based on the provided instructions.
4.  **Team Lead:** This agent orchestrates the other agents, compiling their analyses and recommendations into a final, structured investment report for the user.

The application uses Google's `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` model for the AI agents, providing fast and efficient analysis. It also visualizes the stock price trends using interactive Plotly charts.

## ‚ûï Further Enhancements

* Allow users to specify different timeframes for stock performance analysis.
* Incorporate sentiment analysis of news articles to gauge market perception.
